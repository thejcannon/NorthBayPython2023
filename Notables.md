# Hop on Pop

(Very simple, lots of rhyme, but some fun little ones too)

- The PAT/SAT rhyme could be used: "NO! PAT! NO! ..."

# Green Eggs and Ham

(Good for lists, but that's it, so maybe the math operators?)

# Oh the Places you'll go

- You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes.
- ... With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet
- ... to people as brainy and footsy as you
- Simple it's not I'm afraid you will find, for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind
- (The waiting place runon, maybe good for operators as well?)
- winningest-winner of all

# The Lorax

(Honestly, this one can be used heavily for inspiration. It's very Suess-y)

- (The Truffala Trees repitition)
- With great skillful skill and great speedy speed
- Describe him? ... That's hard. I don't know if I can
- (The Thneed description could also be used for math operators)
- BUT... business is business! And business must grow regardless of crummies in tummies you know
- (biggering quote)
- (and then the next BIGGERING) quote
- (UNLESS)

# Cat in the Hat

(This is also good Suess-y)

- Lots of good fun that is funny
- (Up Up Up with the fish)
- And so [...] so so so... I'll show you another good game that I know
- You did not like our game... oh dear. What a shame! What a shame! What a shame!
- ...Good trick that I know...
- (Pick up section)
- Did not know what to say. Should we tell her the things that went on there that day?
  Should we tell her about it? Now, what SHOULD we do? Well.. What would YOU do If your mother asked YOU?
